Description:    The NEAT project wants to achieve a complete redesign of the
                way in which Internet applications interact with the network.
                The goal is to allow network “services” offered to
                applications – such as reliability, low-delay communication
                or security – to be dynamically tailored based on application
                demands, current network conditions, hardware capabilities or
                local policies, and also to support the integration of new
                network functionality in an evolutionary fashion, without
                applications having to be rewritten. This architectural change
                will make the Internet truly "enhanceable", by allowing
                applications to seamlessly and more easily take advantage of
                new network features as they evolve.
                This package contains the shared library for the NEAT APIs
                libraries and example programs.
