%description
 The NEAT project wants to achieve a complete redesign of the way in which
 Internet applications interact with the network. Our goal is to allow network
 “services” offered to applications – such as reliability, low-delay
 communication or security – to be dynamically tailored based on application
 demands, current network conditions, hardware capabilities or local policies,
 and also to support the integration of new network functionality in an
 evolutionary fashion, without applications having to be rewritten. This
 architectural change will make the Internet truly “enhanceable”, by allowing
 applications to seamlessly and more easily take advantage of new network
 features as they evolve.
