%description
The NEAT project wants to achieve a complete redesign of the way in which
Internet applications interact with the network. The goal is to allow network
“services” offered to applications – such as reliability, low-delay
communication or security – to be dynamically tailored based on application
demands, current network conditions, hardware capabilities or local policies,
and also to support the integration of new network functionality in an
evolutionary fashion, without applications having to be rewritten. This
architectural change will make the Internet truly “enhanceable”, by allowing
applications to seamlessly and more easily take advantage of new network
features as they evolve.
