# This leak is generated by the call to ldns_pkt_rr_list_by_type in
# neat_pvd.c:neat_pvd_dns_ptr_recv_cb. ldns_rr_list_deep_free should be freeing
# the list returned by the aforementioned function, at that seems to be the
# case in the ldns source code, but somehow that is not happening.
# Ignore this leak for now.
